# Reaphsoft Workmen Mono Repo
Now you can run the code below from the root of the project and it will start both the front and backend server at 
the same time.
```
npm start
```

## Stacks
1. The **Frontend** is built using `React` and `Bootstrap`. See the _frontend_ dir for the frontend codes.
2. The **Backend** is built using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/). See the _backend_ dir for its codes.

## Points to note
1. Ensure that the backend port and the front end ports are not the same. You can change the backend port in `src/main.ts`
